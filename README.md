# Everfield Revenue Analysis Case Study

## Project Overview

This repository presents an end-to-end revenue analysis case study for Everfield, encompassing the entire analytics lifecycle—from data collection and cleaning through modeling to interactive dashboards and business recommendations. The project showcases deep technical skills in Python data wrangling, advanced SQL data modeling, exploratory data analysis, visually compelling Power BI dashboards, and recurring revenue analytics.

## Business Objective

The primary objective is to uncover actionable insights from Everfield’s revenue data by cleaning and modeling the data, visualizing revenue trends, and delivering recommendations to inform business growth strategies. A special focus is placed on recurring revenue waterfall analysis, enabling stakeholders to understand the drivers behind revenue changes.

## Tools Used

- **Python (Pandas):** Data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial analysis
- **SQL:** Data modeling and development of fact and dimension tables
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and visual analytics

## Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (Python):**
    - Handled missing data, anomalies, and inconsistent formatting using Pandas.
    - Standardized and transformed raw datasets for downstream analysis.

2. **SQL Data Modeling:**
    - Designed fact and dimension tables for scalable analysis.
    - Structured the data warehouse to support complex revenue analytics.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Identified key revenue drivers and trends using Python and SQL queries.
    - Detected anomalies and opportunities across customer segments and time periods.

4. **Power BI Dashboards:**
    - Developed interactive dashboards to visualize revenue flows and client behaviors.
    - Included a comprehensive recurring revenue waterfall chart for business users.

5. **Recurring Revenue Waterfall Analysis:**
    - Quantified new, churned, expanded, and contracted revenue.
    - Revealed net changes and highlighted areas for revenue optimization.

## Key Insights

- **Revenue Composition:** Clear segmentation between new, retained, churned, and expansion revenue.
- **Churn Analysis:** Identified primary drivers of churn and high-risk customer cohorts.
- **Growth Opportunities:** Pinpointed upsell and cross-sell potential among existing customers.
- **Performance Visualization:** Interactive dashboards enable dynamic investigation of business health.
- **Data Quality:** Early data cleaning improved downstream modeling accuracy and business trust in outputs.
